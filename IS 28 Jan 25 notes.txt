youtube video every computer component explained in 3 mins 

RAM storage is wiped when off.
Secondary storage- SSD(solid state drive) faster than disk drive
Input devices- keyboard mouse, scanner etc.
output devices- printer, video display, disk drives
Software- 2 categories 1. application software, 2. system software
1. application software 
2. system software OS, utility program software development tools

How data is stored- in sequences of 0s and 1s
	Byte- just enough memory to store a letter or number of 8 bits
Bit represents 0 and 1 as values

Computer  use binary numbering system

0   0  1  0  1 1 0 1
       2     2 2   2 with a power of 0 moving up by one from 0-7 this is known as the position value.

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

             1 0 0 1
             2     2

ASCII is limited: defines codes for only 128 characters
Unicode coding scheme becoming standard
	this is compabatible with ASCII
	represent characters ....

Look up ACSII coding scheme


using the table code your name
 01000100  01100001 01110110 01101001 01100100

Fetch- read the next instruction from memory into CPU
Decode CPU decodes fetched instruction to determine which operation to 
Execute perform the operation

Assembly language0 uses short words( mnemonics) instead of binary#s
	2 types
	low level language- think assembly language
	High level language- more intuitive to understand, no need to know how CPU works

Keywords- predefined words used to write a program has specific meaning
Operators performs operations on data
Syntax- 
Statement

Python keywords (will turn blue or purple if a keyword below)
		and, continue, finally, is, raise, as, def, for lamba return, asser del from. 



Python uses interpreter to take a code and writes one instruction at a time No separate machine language needed

Source code: statements written by programmer
	Syntax error prevents code from being translated
